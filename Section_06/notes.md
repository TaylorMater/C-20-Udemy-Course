### 27. Online Compilers:

A few options for online compilers:
-   Wandbox
    - has good options for testing code against specific versions of compilers
-   Compiler Explorer
    - shows you the assembly code generated from your code after compile. Cool for trying to learn assembly. 
-   Coliru
    - shows you the explicit commands it runs, so you can learn compiler arguments/command syntax
-   more (like leetcode playground)

Online compilers benefit from being able to rapidly share a specific file/code snippet and run it without environment setup. Downside, is that it's not super great for huge projects.

### 28. About other IDE's:

Daniel Gakwaya, the creator of this course, recommends staying in VS Code until you master the material, and then branching out to options like Microsoft Visual Studio and CodeLite to practice more.
