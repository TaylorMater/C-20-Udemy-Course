## Errors - C++


### Three Types of Errors:

- Compile Time Errors:
    - Example: forgetting a semicolon, not defining the type of a data structure.
- Runtime Errors:
    - Compilation succeeds, but program does not perform as expected. Usually due to logic problem. Can lead to program crashes.
- Warnings:
    - Not a serious enough problem to stop compilation, but lets you know that some behavior is potentially problematic.
