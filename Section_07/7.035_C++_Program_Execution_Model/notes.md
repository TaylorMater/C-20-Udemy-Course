## C++ Program Execution Model

- Program gets converted to binary by the compiler, and is processed in statements.
- Program is processed in RAM typically, and CPU helps with processing (I believe it performs the actual operations on memory) and logging registry information and jumping between spaces in memory (for example, code statement in memory address 5 says to call a function located in memory address 123, CPU remembers to return back to 5 with output of function upon function completion). 
- Daniel shows one C++ memory model, but there are other ways to visualize it
