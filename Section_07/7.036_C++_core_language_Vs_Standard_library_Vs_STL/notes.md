## C++ core language Vs Standard library Vs STL


- Core features: how to define a variable, basic types, rules for defining functions, etc.
- Standard library consists of specialized components that are useful for C++, like iostream, string, etc. 
- STL is part of the standard library, but is really a collection of container types, algorithms, and iterator types. Think of it as a specialized part of the standard library.
