### Compound Operators:

See learncpp.com's page on arithmetic assignment operators: https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/arithmetic-operators/


Essentially, just shortcuts to assign a variable equal to some basic arithmetic operation applied to itself.

Want to increment x by 5? `x += 5;`
Want to decrement y by 17? `y -= 17;`
Want to multiply z by 3? `z *= 3;`
Want to divide a by 2? `a /= 2;`
Want to assign b to the modulus of b by 3? `b %= 3;`


That's really it here. Nothing new.
