## Math Functions


The `cmath` library contains a lot of helpful mathematical functions.

Just use `#include <cmath>` to import it. See the accompanying main.cpp for specific implementation details, or look up reference documentation.

Here's where you can see some documentation on it: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath



The directory `coding_exercise_3` just contains a simple expression that uses some of the code from this library to calculate the area of a regular hexagon. It's not very difficult at all, but just shows some possible implementation.
