## Literals


- a __literal__ is some data that is directly represented in code without going through some other variable stored in memory. 
    - example: the `3.0` in `thisFunction(3.0)`. Instead of having `3.0` live in a variable, we are literally sending `3.0` to that function. But it still has to be handled by memory in some way. 
    - example: the `5` in the declaration `int num = 5;` That 5 is created in memory to then get assigned to `num`.
