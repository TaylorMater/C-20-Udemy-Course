## Variable Lifetime

- variable lifetime is the period of time in which a variable is "alive" in memory. It becomes "alive" when you declare it, and it is "killed" (wiped out from memory) at some point

- When a variable is "killed" is decided by storage duration
    - local (block, automatic)
    - static
    - dynamic


The accompanying `main.cpp` illustrates this more clearly.
