## If Statements

To be honest, there really isn't too much I don't already know about if statements. But if you need to know more, you can check some of the accompanying `main.cpp` code.

But I would check [here](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-if-statements/) to learn more (source: learncpp.com intro to if statements). 

See the below example from that source:

```
if (condition)
    true_statement;
```

"If the condition of an if statement evaluates to Boolean value true, then true_statement is executed. If the condition instead evaluates to Boolean value false, then true_statement is skipped."


My personal preferred syntax is: 

```
if (some_expression){
    //statement
    //statement
}
```

Technically, I am aware that you can do a one line if statement if it's not very complicated:

```
if (some_expression) return answer;
else {
    //statements
}
```


The if statement inherently evaluates a boolean expression.
